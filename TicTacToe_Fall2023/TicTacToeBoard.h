 * \brief  board class - TicTacToeBoard
 *     Scope - all aspects of the board, including defining the # rows & columns, win conditions, current/starting player
 *        supports retrieving data elements for displaying the board
 * 
 * \author Lee
 * \date   updated: October 2025
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 *     - Player enum is used for both the name of the player & for the player's move
 *     - lots of Technical debt in this implementation, including need to consistently use BOARD_NUM_ROWS and BOARD_NUM_COLS
 *     - the range for valid rows & columns is [0,2], all other values are invalid
 * 
 * constructor                                 - initializes board via resetBoard() method
 * resetBoard()                                - initializes board & number of turns played in current game
 * bool isSquareEmpty(int row, int column)     - returns true = empty, false otherwise
 * bool writeSquare(int row, int column, Player player) - returns false if can’t write square
 * char getSquareContents(int row, int column) - returns character in specified square (e.g. 'X', 'O', ' ')
 * Player getPlayer()                          - returns player (enum) whose turn it is
 * char getPlayerName()                        - returns player (character) whose turn it is
 * Player nextPlayer()                         - returns Player (ie enum) of the next player (e.g. if O playing, returns X)
 * bool isWinner(Player playerToCheck)         - true if the specified player has won, false otherwise
 * bool isDraw()                               - true if no-one has won, false otherwise (e.g. consider - no spaces empty)
